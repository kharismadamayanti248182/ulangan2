                <p>Mount Rushmore National Memorial in Keystone, South Dakota, was carved on the granite face of a mountain in the Black Hills between 1927 and 1941. Funding problems made the project take longer than was originally expected.</p>
                <p>Land grabs, egos, foiled movie scenes—how Mount Rushmore was built is a complex tale.</p>
                <p><u>Mount Rushmore</u> pays patriotic tribute to four United States presidents—<u>George Washington</u>, <u>Thomas Jefferson</u>, <u>Theodore Roosevelt</u>, and <u>Abraham Lincoln</u>—with 60-foot-tall faces carved into a mountainside in the <u>Black Hills</u> of South Dakota.</p>
                <p>Sculpted on sacred <u>Native American land</u> by a man with ties to the <u>Ku Klux</u> Klan, Mount Rushmore National Memorial was fraught with controversy even before it was completed on <u>October 31, 1941.</u></p>
                <p>Over the years, the memorial has drawn protests over its location on Indigenous land, debates about whether another commander-in-chief deserves a spot on the mountain, and a Hollywood controversy over an <u>Alfred Hitchcock</u> movie partially filmed on the site.</p>

                <p>Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, near Keystone. Before it became known as Mount Rushmore, the <u>Lakota</u> called this granite formation Tunkasila Sakpe Paha, or <u>Six Grandfathers Mountain.</u></p>
                <p>It was a place for prayer and devotion for the Native people of the Great Plains, explains <u>Donovin Sprague</u>, head of the history department at <u>Sheridan College</u> in Wyoming and a member of the <u>Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.</u></p>
